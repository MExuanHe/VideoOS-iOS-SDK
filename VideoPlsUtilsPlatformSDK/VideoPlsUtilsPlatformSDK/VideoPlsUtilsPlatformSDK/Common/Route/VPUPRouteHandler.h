 VPUPRouteHandler is a helper class for creating handler blocks intended to be passed to an addRoute: call.
 
 This is specifically useful for cases in which you want a separate object or class to be the handler
 for a deeplink route. An example might be a view controller class that you want to instantiate and present
 in response to a deeplink route.
